# raylib-quadtree-example

The first version was written in just under 1 hour. If it wasn't for a silly malloc bug for the QuadTreeQueryResult, I would have finished it in less than 50 minutes! This example was inspired by [Daniel Shiffman's Coding Challenge](https://youtu.be/OJxEcs0w_kE) on the same subject! Building something like this in C has some complications over JavaScript, but it was a great exercise and a topic I can cover in a few videos on the channel.

In the future I am likely to fork this repo and build a C++ version as well, (which will be much easier than what I've done here to be honest!)
